# Phone Masking Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. New Phone Masking Adapter (`app/adapters/phone_masking.py`)
- **PhoneMaskingAdapter** class that manages masked phone numbers
- Generates unique masked numbers for clients
- Stores and retrieves masked/real phone mappings
- Routes messages through masked numbers
- Supports disabling/releasing masked numbers

### 2. Database Schema Updates (`app/db.py`)
- Added `use_masked_phone` column to `clients` table
- Created new `masked_phones` table to store mappings:
  - `client_id` â†’ `real_phone` â†’ `masked_phone`
  - Includes timestamps for audit trail

### 3. API Schema Updates (`app/schemas.py`)
- Added `use_masked_phone: bool` field to `ClientCreate` model
- Defaults to `False` for backward compatibility

### 4. Main Application Updates (`app/main.py`)
- Integrated PhoneMaskingAdapter into the application
- Updated client creation to generate masked numbers when requested
- Updated SMS sending to automatically use masked numbers
- Added 3 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /clients/{id}/masked-phone`
  - `POST /clients/{id}/masked-phone`
  - `DELETE /clients/{id}/masked-phone`
- Updated index view to display masked phone info

### 5. UI Updates
- **Form** (`templates/index.html`):
  - Added "Use Phone Masking" toggle switch with description
  - Shows privacy protection message
  
- **Client List** (`templates/index.html`):
  - Displays masked phone number with ðŸ”’ icon
  - Green badge to highlight masked numbers
  
- **JavaScript** (`static/app.js`):
  - Handles phone masking checkbox
  - Shows alert with generated masked number

### 6. Documentation
- **PHONE_MASKING.md**: Comprehensive guide to the phone masking feature
- **README.md**: Updated with phone masking overview and usage
- **test_phone_masking.py**: Automated test script

## How It Works

```
User Action: Create Client with "Phone Masking" enabled
     â†“
API receives: {phone: "+1-555-0001", use_masked_phone: true}
     â†“
PhoneMaskingAdapter.create_phone_mask()
     â†“
Generates: "+1-555-MASK-1234"
     â†“
Stores in DB: client_id â†’ +1-555-0001 â†’ +1-555-MASK-1234
     â†“
Returns to user: "Client created with masked phone: +1-555-MASK-1234"
```

## Message Routing Flow

```
User sends SMS to client_id=5
     â†“
Check: client.use_masked_phone == True?
     â†“ Yes
Query masked_phones table for client_id=5
     â†“
Found: masked_phone = "+1-555-MASK-1234"
     â†“
Use masked number instead of real number
     â†“
MessagingAdapter.send_sms("+1-555-MASK-1234", body)
     â†“
[Production: Masking service routes to real number]
```

## Configuration

Environment variables for production:
```bash
PHONE_MASKING_ENABLED=true        # Enable/disable service
PHONE_MASKING_PROVIDER=twilio     # Provider name (twilio/bandwidth/plivo)
MASKING_POOL_NUMBER=+1-555-PROXY  # Display number for pool
```

## Testing

The prototype includes simulated masked numbers in format: `+1-555-MASK-XXXX`

In production, these would be:
- Real phone numbers from your provider's pool
- Automatically provisioned and managed
- Can receive calls and SMS
- Route to actual client phone numbers

## Production-Ready Features

âœ… Database schema with proper foreign keys
âœ… Unique constraints on masked numbers
âœ… Timestamps for audit trail
âœ… Error handling for edge cases
âœ… RESTful API endpoints
âœ… Automatic routing logic
âœ… UI integration
âœ… Documentation

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Choose a Provider**:
   - Twilio Proxy (recommended for simplicity)
   - Bandwidth (good for high volume)
   - Plivo (international support)

2. **Implement Real API Calls**:
   - Update `PhoneMaskingAdapter` to call provider APIs
   - Handle phone number provisioning from pool
   - Implement webhook handlers for incoming messages

3. **Add Webhook Endpoints**:
   - Receive incoming SMS to masked numbers
   - Route to appropriate real numbers
   - Log all communications

4. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Call masking (voice calls)
   - Session-based masking (expires after X days)
   - Number pool management
   - Analytics and reporting

## Security Considerations

- Real phone numbers are stored but never exposed in UI
- Masked numbers are unique per client
- Database access controls protect phone mappings
- Audit trail tracks all masked number generation
- Easy to revoke/release masked numbers
