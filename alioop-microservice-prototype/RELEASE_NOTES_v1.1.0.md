- ✅ Never commit this file to version control

- ✅ Use environment-specific keys (dev/prod)

**Current Protection:**
- SendGrid API keys stored in `.env` only

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Email Best Practices
1. **Verify Your Sender** - Always verify sender email in SendGrid
2. **Use Restricted Keys** - Give API keys only "Mail Send" permission
3. **Monitor Usage** - Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery stats
4. **Test First** - Use `quick_email_test.py` before app testing

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **401 Unauthorized** → Create a new API key with Mail Send permission
- **403 Forbidden** → Verify your sender email in SendGrid
- **Email not received** → Check spam folder, verify sender reputation
