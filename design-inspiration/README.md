# Design Inspiration & Reference

This folder contains reference images, mockups, and design inspiration for the Alioop platform.

## 📐 Purpose

Drop any design files here that serve as:
- Visual inspiration for UI/UX
- Design mockups and prototypes
- Reference images for color schemes
- Example layouts from other sites
- Mood boards and style guides
- Screenshots of design ideas

## 🎨 What to Put Here

- Design mockups (Figma exports, Sketch files, etc.)
- Screenshots of websites you like
- Color palette references
- Typography examples
- UI component inspiration
- Wireframes and sketches

## 📝 Note

These files are for **reference only** - they won't be used directly on the live site. Once you implement a design element, the actual production assets should go in:

```
alioop-microservice-prototype/static/images/
```

## 💡 Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `hero-section-inspiration.png`
- Add notes in this README about specific elements you like
- Organize by page/section if helpful
